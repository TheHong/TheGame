The following are the bugs and considerations of a particular version.

===v1.0.0===
-When minimize app during name prompting, after submitting, new entry is repeated (same timestamp, name, and score)
	=> Can't recreate, but have code ready just in case still a bug
-Another entry was also repeated. It's a repeat bronze. The previous repeat might also be repeat bronze.
	=> See above
-When click fast in The Pitch or something, notes keep playing in background. (happened twice)
	=> Fixed. It was due to async still running
-The trill, sometimes final score shown in prompt is not correct.
	=> TODO
