Bar of The Trill could be improved
The Trill have cases where final score in prompt not same as current score (Possibly because did not update fast enough?)
Consider using ListTile to have title and subtitle (https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/demo/menu)
Expand the developer's suite with more backup options and displays (e.g. stats, info about backup, renaming backups (by copying))
Find way to export (and maybe use developer suite as backup export button?)
Vibration
Sometimes counter for The Trill does not start
Restrict access to datastore
Buttons have a disabled colour field. Use it
Keep in mind difference between padding and margins. Change some variable names.
Why does gamecore not get disposed when not using a Consumer. Compare commits 5f2618d1 with 07c26f74.
