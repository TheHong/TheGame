Bar of The Trill could be improved
The Trill have cases where final score in prompt not same as current score (Possibly because did not update fast enough?)
Consider using ListTile to have title and subtitle (https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/demo/menu)
Expand the developer's suite with more backup options and displays (e.g. stats, info about backup, renaming backups (by copying))
Find way to export (and maybe use developer suite as backup export button?)
Vibration
Sometimes counter for The Trill does not start
