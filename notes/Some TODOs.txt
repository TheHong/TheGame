Bar is could be improved
The Trill have cases where final score in prompt not same as current score (Possibly because did not update fast enough?)
Consider using ListTile to have title and subtitle (https://gallery.flutter.dev/#/demo/menu)
Remove the additional score compatibility check
Prolong the notice that result updates not available
For results page, also display additional score
Expand the developer's suite with more backup options and displays (e.g. stats, info about backup, renaming backups (by copying))
Set up backup names for important backups (so don't overwrite)
Find way to export (and maybe use developer suite as backup export button?)
Vibration
Sometimes counter does not start
Display number of correct even if not leaderboard in the pitch
